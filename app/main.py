Welcome to the V2H energy simulation application.  
This interface allows you to visualize the energy exchanges between:
- an electric vehicle (EV),
- a house (energy demand),
- photovoltaic (solar) production (PV),
- and the power grid.

ðŸš§ This version is under construction. Many features will be added soon.
